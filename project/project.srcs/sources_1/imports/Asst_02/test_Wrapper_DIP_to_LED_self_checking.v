/* // The following prompt was used with Claude Sonnet 4 with the following prompt, and the non-self-checking code, as in test_Wrapper_DIP_to_LED.v 
I am writing a testbench for a single-cycle RISC-V processor. 
I want to make the testbench below self-checking, without modifying the existing code substantially. Please have it in pure Verilog, adding the code for monitoring, scoreboarding, and message printing. 
Sample DIP[7:0] at the end of the cycle where LED_PC = 0x07 (i.e., at the positive clock edge when it transitions to 0x08) and see if it is reflected in LED_OUT[7:0] exactly 1 cycle later, i.e., at the positive clock edge when LED_PC transitions from 0x08 to 0x09. This has to be done on a continuous basis, i.e., LED_PC could become 0x07 over and over every few cycles.
LED_PC displays the PC bits [8:2]; it is 0x07 for lw instruction to read DIP, and is 0x08 for sw to write to LED_OUT. Parameterise 0x07 and 0x08 as the bits [6:2] of LW_DIP_PC_ADDRESS and SW_LED_PC_ADDRESS (the addresses being 9 bit values), and the number of cycles in between LW_SW_CYCLES which is 0 by default.
